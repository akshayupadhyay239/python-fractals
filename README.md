# python-fractals
A fractal is a never-ending pattern. Fractals are infinitely complex patterns that are self-similar across different scales. They are created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop.
These fractals are not infine because these are still art of fractals created with python's turtle library.
If you wanted to contribute for some more frctals you are more than welcome.
